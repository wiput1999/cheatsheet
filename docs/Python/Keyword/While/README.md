# while
while is used for looping in Python.

The statements inside a while loop continue to execute until the condition for the while loop evaluates to False or a break statement is encountered. Following program illustrates this.
```python
i = 5
while(i):
    print(i)
    i = i â€“ 1
```
```
Output

5
4
3
2
1
```
Note that 0 is equal to False.
