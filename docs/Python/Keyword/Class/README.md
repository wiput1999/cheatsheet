# class
class is used to define a new user-defined class in Python.

Class is a collection of related attributes and methods that try to represent a real world situation. This idea of putting data and functions together in a class is central to the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP).

Classes can be defined anywhere in a program. But it is a good practice to define a single class in a module. Following is a sample usage:
```python
class ExampleClass:
    def function1(parameters):
        …
    def function2(parameters):
        …
```
