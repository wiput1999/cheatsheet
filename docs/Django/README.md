Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

This repository is made for Django source code and how to do repository.

I aimed to create a polling application from Django, using HTML, CSS, JS and Django itself to make it possible.

Thanks to Udemy course, Django Foundation course.
